Containerization is the process of packaging an application along with its required 
environment, configurations, libraries, and dependencies so that it can run uniformly 
and consistently across different computing environments. A container maintains an 
isolated environment for running the application, and this allows developers to manage 
and worry less about the underlying system software and infrastructure. Docker is the 
most widely used containerization platform.

Containers offer several benefits:

    Consistent environments: Containers include the application and all of its dependencies, 
                                ensuring it runs the same way in every environment.

    Isolation: Containers are isolated from each other on the same host, so each application 
                can have its own libraries without conflict with others.

    Portability: Containers can be run on any machine that has the container runtime, which 
                    makes them highly portable.

    Efficiency: Containers use shared operating systems, making them lighter weight than 
                    virtual machines.

Containerization and orchestration go hand in hand in modern software delivery lifecycle, 
especially in achieving CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment).
