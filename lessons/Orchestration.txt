Orchestration is all about managing the lifecycles of containers, especially in large, 
dynamic environments. Orchestration tools help in deployment, scaling, networking, and 
availability of containers. Kubernetes is the leading container orchestration platform.

Container orchestration offers several benefits:

    Service discovery and load balancing: Orchestration tools can distribute network traffic 
                                            to maintain the balance across the containers to 
                                            ensure no single container is burdened.

    Storage orchestration: Orchestration allows you to automatically mount a storage system of 
                            your choice, such as local storage, public cloud providers, and more.

    Automated rollouts and rollbacks: You can describe the desired state for your deployed 
                                        containers using orchestration, and the system changes 
                                        the actual state to the desired state at a controlled 
                                        rate.

    Automatic bin packing: You provide the orchestration system with a cluster of nodes that it 
                            can use to run containerized tasks.

    Self-healing: Orchestration replaces and reschedules containers when a node dies. It also 
                    kills containers that don’t respond to health checks, and doesn’t advertise 
                    them to clients until they are ready to serve.

Containerization and orchestration go hand in hand in modern software delivery lifecycle, 
especially in achieving CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment).
